**Whacdamole** is a single Python script that acts as a Kubernetes CD operator and CLI tool for Kubernetes app development. Whacdamole automates Docker image builds, Helm and Kustomize deployments, and implements GitOps.

At some point I realised that I didn't want to have to build and deploy a hundred different projects to just verify a single application on Kubernetes. I decided to make this monstrosity to try and pack everything into yet-another-yaml-config that covers probably most of what you'd need to prototype an app for Kubernetes (hence Whackamole).

## Prerequisites üöö

Before using Whacdamole, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Kubernetes Cluster**: Access to a Kubernetes cluster.
    - **Helm**: Installed for deploying Helm charts.
    - **Kubectl**: Installed for interacting with Kubernetes.
- **Docker**: Installed and configured for building images.
- **Python 3.12+**: Required if running the CLI tool from source.
- **Git**: For cloning repositories.

## Installation üèóÔ∏è

### Using Docker

Whacdamole can be containerised using Docker. This approach encapsulates all dependencies, ensuring consistency across environments.

1. **Build the Docker Image**

   ```bash
   docker build -t whacdamole:latest .
   ```

2. **Run the Docker Container**

   ```bash
   docker run --rm -it whacdamole:latest --help
   ```

### From Source

For those who prefer running Whacdamole directly from the source:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/3percentavos/whacdamole.git
   cd whacdamole
   ```

2. **Install Python Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Make the Script Executable**

   ```bash
   chmod +x whacdamole
   ```

4. **Add to PATH (Optional)**

   ```bash
   sudo mv whacdamole /usr/local/bin/
   ```

### Deploy the Kubernetes operator

This is experimental! If you're using this as an actual CD solution, install it on Kubernetes. This assumes you have already installed whacdamole.


1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/whacdamole.git
   cd whacdamole
   ```

2. **Deploy [`.whacdamole`](.whacdamole)**

   ```bash
   ./whacdamole deploy
   ```

## Usage üíª

Whacdamole provides a command-line interface (CLI) with several subcommands to manage your Kubernetes resources efficiently.

### Configuration

Whacdamole relies on a `.whacdamole` YAML configuration file located in the current directory. This file defines project details, Docker images, and deployment configurations.

**Example `.whacdamole` Configuration:**

```yaml
apiVersion: whackdamole.github.com/v1beta
kind: Whacdamole
metadata:
  name: my-project
spec:
  name: MyProject
  version: "1.0.0"
  gitRepository: https://github.com/example/my-project.git
  branchToWatch: main
  localEnvironment:
    enableLocalKubernetes: true
    enableLocalDockerRegistry: true
    localDockerRegistryPort: 5000
    localDockerRegistries:
      - "http://my-registry.local:5000"
    kubeconfig: "/home/user/.kube/config"
  dockerImages:
    - name: backend
      tags:
        - "0.0.1"
        - "latest"
      registry: docker.io/myrepo
      directory: ./services/backend
    - name: frontend
      tags:
        - "0.0.1"
        - "latest"
      registry: docker.io/myrepo
      directory: ./services/frontend
  helmDeployments:
    - gitRepository: https://github.com/example/helm-charts.git
      branchToWatch: release
      chartPath: charts/mychart
      values: |
        replicaCount: 2
        image:
          repository: myrepo/backend
          tag: "0.0.1"
      overrides:
        environment: production
        debug: "false"
  kustomizeDeployments:
    - gitRepository: https://github.com/example/kustomize-configs.git
      branchToWatch: develop
      kustomizePath: overlays/production
```

When needing to pull an image from the local registry when deploying Kustomize manifests or Helm Charts to the the local Kubernetes cluster, point to `whacdamole.registry`.

### CLI Commands

#### `whacdamole registry up {options}`

**Description:**  
Start the local Docker registry based on the `.whacdamole` configuration in the current directory using Docker.

**Options:**

- `--image registry:2`  
  Specifies which Docker image to use for the registry. Defaults to `registry:2` if not provided.

**Usage:**

```bash
whacdamole registry up --image registry:2
```

#### `whacdamole build`

**Description:**  
Builds all Docker images defined in the `.whacdamole` configuration and pushes them to the specified registries using Docker.

**Usage:**

```bash
whacdamole build
```

#### `whacdamole deploy`

**Description:**  
Deploys all specified Helm charts and Kustomize configurations. If there are Git repository overrides, Whacdamole pulls those repositories and deploys from the specified paths using Helm and kubectl.

**Usage:**

```bash
whacdamole deploy
```

#### `whacdamole gitops`

**Description:**  
Starts the GitOps routine, monitoring the Kubernetes cluster for `Whacdamole` resources. It deploys and periodically redeploys Helm charts and Kustomize manifests based on the custom resource definitions. This command is intended to run within the Kubernetes operator's Docker container.

**Usage:**

```bash
whacdamole gitops
```

**Note:**  
Ensure that this command is executed in an environment with access to the Kubernetes API server, typically from within a Kubernetes cluster.
